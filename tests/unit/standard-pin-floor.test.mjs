// what-it-is:   the E62 evidence - what an arbitrarily old Standard pin buys a plugin
// what-it-does: grades tests/fixtures/audit-corpus/pin-abuse at its pinned 0.9 and at three other pin
//               values, and pins what the gate does with each
// why:          E62 (the pin has no floor) said its central figure came from a fixture "this repository
//               cannot currently rebuild". That made the finding a citation of someone else's run. This
//               file rebuilds it in-tree, so the number is ours and any future floor can be shown to work
// used-by:      npm test; tests/fixtures/audit-corpus/pin-abuse is the tree it grades

/**
 * WHAT THIS FIXTURE IS, AND WHY IT IS PINNED RATHER THAN FIXED.
 *
 * `pin-abuse` is the audit's `09-pin-abuse` rebuilt in-tree: the Potemkin Gold tree, declared Advanced,
 * pinned to `"standard": "0.9"`, and then made to violate eight requirements introduced after 0.9. Every
 * one of those violations is downgraded to a warning by the pin alone, so the gate passes it.
 *
 * ONE VIOLATION FROM THE AUDIT'S TREE IS NOT CHECKED IN: the broken `docs/reference/diagram.md` that
 * trips `U12` (mermaid-valid). `U12` scans a repository repo-wide, `tests/` is not in `SKIP_DIRS`, and a
 * committed broken diagram therefore fails THIS repository's own gate - measured, not argued: adding it
 * moved `node scripts/check.mjs .` from Advanced/0 errors to None/2 errors. The repo's own `U12` tests
 * write their bad blocks into a tmpdir for the same reason. The ninth waived check is reproduced the
 * same way below, in a copy, which is where the audit's fourteen-warning figure comes back exactly.
 *
 * These are characterization tests. They assert what the gate DOES today. The remedy - bounding how far
 * back a pin may reach - is D-02, which is downstream of the deferred D-01 (a health score beside the
 * tier). When a floor lands, REWRITE these assertions; do not force this file green.
