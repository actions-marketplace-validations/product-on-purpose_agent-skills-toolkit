// what-it-is:   the post-publish registry assertion (WS-B, release identity)
// what-it-does: asks the npm registry whether the version this tag names is actually THERE, after the
//               publish step claims to have put it there, and fails the run when it is not
// why:          `npm publish` exiting 0 was the only evidence this repository had that a release
//               reached the registry, and that evidence comes from INSIDE the thing it certifies -
//               nothing here ever asked the registry. publish-npm.yml's own docblock names a forgotten
//               publish as a SILENT failure and trades it for a visible one; this closes the other
//               half, a publish that was not forgotten and still did not land
// used-by:      .github/workflows/publish-npm.yml, the "Verify the registry actually has this version"
//               step in the `publish` job; covered by tests/unit/verify-published-version.test.mjs
//
// PURE SPLIT FROM IMPURE, the same shape scripts/lib/release-ready.mjs and scripts/lib/vendor-watch.mjs
// use: `assessPackument` decides, and takes an already-parsed document plus the expected version.
// Nothing in it touches the network, the clock or the filesystem, so every verdict below - present,
// absent, unreadable - is tested without a registry.
//
// EXIT CODES, deliberately the same 1-versus-2 split vendor-watch and action-pin-watch use:
//   0  the registry serves this exact version. The publish landed.
//   1  the registry answered, and this version is NOT there. The publish did not land, or landed under
//      a different number. This is a fact about THIS release.
//   2  the registry could not be READ at all. Nothing is proven either way.
// Both non-zero codes fail the workflow step, and that is correct even though the publish above it is
// irreversible: red here means UNVERIFIED, not "rolled back". Nothing is undone by this script, and a
// run that could not confirm the release must not read as one that did. There is no override flag,
// unlike release-ready's `--allow-vendor-unreachable`: an override exists to let a release proceed
// despite somebody else's outage, and by the time this runs there is no release left to let proceed.
